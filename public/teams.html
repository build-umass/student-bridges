          earned a Ph.D. at UMass, in the department of Educational Policy and Research with a concentration in Higher

          and earned a Master’s degree in Policies Studies in Education from the College of Education at UMass. Yedalis
          is a first-generation, bilingual Puerto Rican college graduate dedicated to addressing issues of access and
          equity in higher education. Through her professional and academic work, she has focused on the critical
          analysis of the educational trajectories of minoritized students. Her dissertation research examined the high
          school student college-going identity formation process to expand existing theories of college access and
          choice to include the experiences, knowledge and beliefs of youth of color who are first generation college
          aspirants.</p>

          grew up in a Spanish-speaking household in NYC and NJ. Olga’s research and career interests focus on expanding
          the availability of school-based mental health supports for underrepresented students in K-12. Trauma
          influences student learning and achievement, therefore the implementation of supports to support specific
          student’s needs will increase high school graduation rates along with college acceptance, retention, and
          completion rates. This fuels her passion and desire to continue working with youth - they are our future!

          the youth, because that is where most individuals experience some of the first effects of inequality. Students
          should be learning and uplifting themselves by creating their future goals instead of being discouraged. She
          also believes in the importance of bridging the gap to inequality in education by allowing the youth more
          access to resources.
