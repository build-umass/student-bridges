            <p>During the fall, students examine how race, class and a variety of historical forces shape students'
                access to quality education and impact college access for many low-income, first-generation, and
                students of color.</p>

            <h3>SRVCLRNG 393 - Advanced Community Service Learning (4 credits)</h3>
            <p>In the spring, students apply their understanding to an educational issue of choice to research and
                develop a project or initiative. The courses include a community engagement component that offers an
                opportunity for each student to engage in a school-based community program at our community partner
                sites.</p>

            <h3>SRVCLRNG 298 - Practicum (2 credits)</h3>
            <p>A student-taught practicum course that pairs juniors and seniors with first-year and/or transfer students
                who identify as underrepresented and/or first generation in a mentorship partnership. This course aims
                to provide sustainable mentorship in the local and campus community as a strategy for increasing
                retention among students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>

            <h3>SRVCLRNG 398 Practicum (2-4 credits)</h3>
            <p>This is a service learning practicum that places college students into local high schools and middle
                schools as tutor mentors. Meanwhile, providing frameworks and reflections about community engagement and
                how the education system affects underrepresented students. Our goal is to bridge academic theory and
                practice and engage students as tutor mentors both in the classroom and within the community through
                civic engagement and community-based collaborations.</p>
