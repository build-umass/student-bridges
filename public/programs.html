          <p class="card-text">
            The Ambassadors program is a group independent study/practicum for undergraduate and graduate students who
            are
            interested in working with high school and middle school
            students in our community partner sites in fall semester and spring semesters. Students
            taking the independent study will be engaging in critical reflections and research with high
            school students and undergraduate students from Student Bridges and will aim to develop a
            research project related to college access in the community.

            The Mentorship Program is a two credit class which allows upperclassmen to mentor underclassmen during the
            duration of a semester. This is intended to foster a community on campus for underrepresented students and
            directly ties into our goal of retention.

            The RRR program is a student initiated program within the agency that combines three big needs that
            underrepresented students have on campus: rentals, referrals, and resources. We address the issue of first
            generation and low income students not being able to purchase items such as calculators so we offer a rental
            program that is in the process of growing. We offer in-person referrals to on and off campus resources that
            are effective and culturally appropriate for the populations we serve. We are currently provide different
            resources such as our supply closet, internet and printing services, lamination, mini food pantry, etc.
