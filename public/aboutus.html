      <h2>History</h2>
      <div class="container w-75" id="history-text">
        <p>Over the course of the last several decades, higher education has become the main symbol of and platform
          for upward social mobility. Within that same time period, access to higher education for underrepresented
          students has remained low and new barriers have been added in the form of sharp increases in the cost of
          attendance at colleges and universities across the country. While financial barriers have traditionally
          been a significant hurdle for underrepresented students, history has shown that coping with the climate of
          a college or university campus has been a clear source of problems facing underrepresented students once
          admitted to an institution of higher education. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, racially
          charged events such as the Mill House Incident in 1970, the racial riot after Game 7 of the 1986 World
          Series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets known as the Southwest Incident or the racially
          motivated attack on a Resident Assistant...

            Student Bridges (SB) aims to expand community partnerships, solidify campus partners to increase
            programming, and increase policy advocacy campaigns. SB has existing partnerships with Upward Bound at
            Commerce in Springfield, Holyoke High School, and Amherst Regional Middle School. SB seeks the
            opportunity to expand into alternative high schools and other schools that may not yet have a college
            access and awareness focus or program. We believe it would be a good use of our resources to look into
            establishing these connections so every student possible is able to view higher education as a viable
            option.

            SB aims to create a foundation of on-campus partners, both academic and social, to create comprehensive
            programming for the campus community. SB strives to ensure students are being provided support and
            guidance both in and outside of classes—especially as the majority of students’ time and college
            experiences occur outside of the classroom. We believe these partnerships will further enhance SB's goal
            of being a network and space for all aspects of students’ lives. Additionally, SB will continue to
            develop its capacity as a safe social space to promote wellness and positive mental health for
            first-generation students and underrepresented students at UMass. By creating a space, tools, and
            programming that address the holistic student experience, participants in SB programming, community and
            space will likely share their experiences and learning with peers thereby expanding SB reach.
