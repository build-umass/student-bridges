              Over the course of the last several decades, higher education has become the main symbol of and platform
              for upward social mobility. Within that same time period, access to higher education for underrepresented
              students has remained low and new barriers have been added in the form of sharp increases in the cost of
              attendance at colleges and universities across the country. While financial barriers have traditionally
              been a significant hurdle for underrepresented students, history has shown that coping with the climate of
              a college or university campus has been a clear source of problems facing underrepresented students once
              admitted to an institution of higher education. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, racially
              charged events such as the Mill House Incident in 1970, the racial riot after Game 7 of the 1986 World
              Series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets known as the Southwest Incident or the racially
              motivated attack on a Resident Assistant in 1992. <br><br>
              Each of these incidents unearthed the hostile environment underrepresented students faced at the
              University after overcoming serious obstacles to earning a spot as a student at the University. With the
              recognition of the difficulties and disadvantages underrepresented students face in the admissions process
              as well as on the University’s campus, a dedicated network of students in the fall of 2005 made the
              decision to actively pursue an avenue to level the playing field for underrepresented students. Not only
              did specific events such as the Southwest Incident and the 1992 attack of a Resident Assistant motivate
              these students but also a shift in the admissions policies at the University. In 1996, the University made
              the decision to deemphasize race in the in the admissions process which resulted in a drop of ALANA
              (African, Latinx, Asian/ Pacific Islander, and Native American) freshman admission rates in the years that
              followed this decision. The drop in the admission rates of ALANA students coupled with the other known
              hurdles, the network of students drafted a proposal for a program titled “Low Income Access Outreach”
              Program. <br><br>
              The “Low Income Access Outreach” Program was proposed after conducting extensive interviews with students,
              faculty, staff, administrators and community members and would be funded with $185,000 from the Student
              Government Association. Based on the feedback from these interviews, the network developed a proposal for
              a student-to-student outreach project designed to increase reciprocal relationships between the UMass
              campus and local communities. The goal of the “Low Income Access Outreach” develop and provide direct
              resources to increase pathways to higher education for local community members. Additionally, members of
              the program would engage in policy evaluations and advocacy designed to effect long-term, systematic
              enhancement of the University’s outreach efforts and its accessibility to underrepresented students.
              <br><br>
              After releasing the first proposal, another draft was put forth by the Race and Economic Justice Task
              Force of the Student Center for Educational Research and Advocacy (SCERA). Although the goal of the new
              program was largely unchanged from the first proposal, the language in the latest proposal stressed the
              need to create “bridges between UMass students and working-class communities” (p.1, “Student Bridges”
              Pilot Program Proposal 3/30/06). The shift in language represents the one for the core aspects of what is
              now known as Student Bridges: to develop and maintain a mutually beneficial relationship between UMass and
              the local communities. This proposal was ultimately introduced to the Student Government Association. The
              Student Government Association made the decision to provide $100,000 in funding for the “Student Bridges
              Pilot Program”. Once the funding was obtained, students worked tirelessly throughout the summer of 2006 to
              ensure that Student Bridges would be successfully implemented in the fall. <br><br>

              Student Bridges was fully operational in September of 2006 and in just two short months, Student Bridges
              was granted independent agency status by the Student Government Association. The new status of Student
              Bridges allowed the organization to obtain its’ own office space, increase funding, and to expand the
              organization. After over a decade, Student Bridges has continued to carry out its mission, work in
              conjunction with surrounding communities and provide support to students in the UMass community. <br><br>

            Commerce in Springfield, Holyoke High School, and Amherst Regional Middle School. SB seeks the
            opportunity to expand into alternative high schools and other schools that may not yet have a college
            access and awareness focus or program. We believe it would be a good use of our resources to look into
            establishing these connections so every student possible is able to view higher education as a viable
            option.

            SB aims to create a foundation of on-campus partners, both academic and social, to create comprehensive
            programming for the campus community. SB strives to ensure students are being provided support and
            guidance both in and outside of classes—especially as the majority of students’ time and college
            experiences occur outside of the classroom. We believe these partnerships will further enhance SB's goal
            of being a network and space for all aspects of students’ lives. Additionally, SB will continue to
            develop its capacity as a safe social space to promote wellness and positive mental health for
            first-generation students and underrepresented students at UMass. By creating a space, tools, and
            programming that address the holistic student experience, participants in SB programming, community and
            space will likely share their experiences and learning with peers thereby expanding SB reach.
